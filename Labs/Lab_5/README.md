## Troubleshoot Summary

- Installed Conda paho-mqtt
- Installed Conda Mosquitto, uninstalled
- Installed Mosquitto within Windows C:\Program Files\Mosquitto
- which mosquitto works only in cmd prompt, msys2 terminal cannot view
- which mosquitto_sub only showed conda until uninstalled from conda
- which mosquitto_sub shows on correct path
- Tried disabling Domain network, Private network, and Public network (active) firewalls to allow mosquitto_sub to run

## Current Problem
- mosquitto command runs fine until closed with Ctrl + C
- mosquitto_sub commands give Error
  - Error: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.

### Cannot Copy PC's RSA Key, Generating ed25519 (preferrence) and naming keygen as Ubuntu

- Ubuntu environment should be shared by both laptop and PC regardless once that is set up.

### Git setup successful, will now set up process onto Laptop and sync Ubuntu accounts for WSL2

- Also resetting all generated keys to ed25519, and removing msys2 as well as gitbash relationship to starting with msys2

### VSCode, Git, and Ubunutu (WSL) working for both PC and Laptop, all ssh keys regenerated to ed25519 and manually synced User, Pass, home folder, for both Ubuntu instances. \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\johnmfb\.vscode-server needed to be regenerated by Laptop VSCode instance to avoid eror

### Created activate_conda_env.sh file to activate anaconda when accessing WSL terminal

### Will delete activate_conda_env.sh, finding alternative path to utilize one conda for both cmd and Ubuntu

### wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
- Derived from following Anaconda Download Link
